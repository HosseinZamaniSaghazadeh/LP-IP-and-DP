# Operations Research: Linear, Integer, and Dynamic Programming

This repository contains implementations of classic optimization problems using **Linear Programming (LP)**, **Integer Programming (IP)**, and **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. The problems are inspired by foundational textbooks in operations research and dynamic programming.
